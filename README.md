This repository demonstrates a common issue in React Router Dom v6 where the catch-all route `*` does not correctly handle unmatched routes.  The problem arises when other routes are defined that partially overlap the catch-all route.  The solution illustrates how to fix this problem by ensuring that the catch-all route is the last route defined in the `Routes` component.  This ensures that it only matches routes after all other routes have been checked.
